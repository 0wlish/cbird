cbird is a CLI tool for birders to manage their birdwatching data locally. If you use eBird, you can download your data at [https://ebird.org/downloadMyData](https://ebird.org/downloadMyData). You can then import your data with ```cbird import```.

DISCLAIMER: You need to import your data before doing anything!

If you want a sample dataset to test it with, download one from [https://cloud-d08c1zfcg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0myebirddata.csv](https://cloud-d08c1zfcg-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0myebirddata.csv)
